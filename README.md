This is custom made case study to emphasize core practices in machine learning. (Feature engineering, data analysis, model development, etc.) 

Things that can be done to improve this case study are as follows:

- Investigate each of the questions listed in the sales_EDA notebook
- Provide more detail in tableau charts (metrics)
- Tune the model
- Think deeper on how to feature engineer the data and what features are not already represented
